# Card Hand
A hand with cards, commonly seen in various card games.

The idea is to show a small simple project where cards can be dragged and dropped between hands to show some basic Godot 4 features

Implement a card hand using Node2d, there is a gotcha in using Control where gui_input method blocks click-through which makes it impossible to ask Godot "what card am i currently hovering over?"
